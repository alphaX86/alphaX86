## Who am I?

I'm a 18 y/o student developer who just wants to explore everything in Tech. It may be of cloud, Algo or something. Other than that, I'm a part time gamer (well, not PRO exactly :smile:)

Here are my facts to be more clear:
- 🔭 I’m currently working on Python3, C++, React, FOSS development and other stuffs. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the basics of FOSS, ML, Full-stack development using MERN, DevOps (if you think I'm polyglot, I'm not. So don't think me bad, especially for haters xD) 
- ❤️ I love to code and play games.
- 💬 Ask me about anything related to tech. I'll try to sort them of course!
- 📫 How to reach me: Through Discord or through other platforms below. 
- 😄 Pronouns: He/Him/His
- :book: Tech Stack: ReactJS, C/C++, SQL, Typescript and Go (in progress xD) 
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't ever care for those who hate me. One day, they'll turn to normal again.
